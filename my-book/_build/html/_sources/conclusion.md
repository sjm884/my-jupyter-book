To finish off the requirements of this assignment I will leave you with my favorite equations!
Gravational force, where m is the mass of objects and r is the distance between the center of those objects.
```{math}
:label: graviy
F_g = \frac{m_1\times m_2}{r^2}
```
The area of a circle.
```{math}
:label: area-circle
A = \pi\times r^2
```
```{warning}
Some of the references in this book are not rendering correctly. Sarah was unable to solve the issue before the time of publication - but the hunt continues.
